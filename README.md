Hello! I'm the Vice President of Technology at [Varland Plating](https://varland.com), where I focus a lot of time on industrial automation. My professional focus includes leveraging tools like [CODESYS](https://www.codesys.com/), [Ignition](https://inductiveautomation.com/), [Copia](https://www.copia.io/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), and [Groov EPIC](https://www.opto22.com/products/groov-epic-system/what-is-epic) to optimize and innovate in the manufacturing space. With a strong background in both the technical and managerial aspects of automation, I bring a wealth of experience and a passion for advancing industrial technology.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I have a rich background in photography and videography, and I enjoy indulging in design projects. I'm also actively involved in the community, serving on the board of the theatre booster organization for my kids' high school, where I support the arts and foster young talent.

Connect with me to explore insights on industrial automation or to collaborate on exciting tech and design projects.
